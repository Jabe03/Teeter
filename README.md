###For frontend implementation:
In /Teeter/profiles, there is a sample_profile.json that you can change to 
include everything you want to have in a profile. I will implement the structure
for everything you put down in the sample_profile.json class, just focus on 
getting eveything you want for a profile 
(and only writing it down in the sample_profile.json file) 
and displaying it on the webpage. The function for sending the request and
displaying the result is written in index.html, starting on line 32. The elements 
that it is referencing when it says "document.getElementByID(...)" is at the bottom 
of the file. I wrote some comments and a couple sample json entries for the 
sample_profile.json file. 

To run the code, run MainApplication.java and wait for it to says the server has 
started in  x seconds, then you can press the buttons on the html file
